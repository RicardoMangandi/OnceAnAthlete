# OnceAnAthlete

This application is an Android app. The backend features were completed with Parse Server. The Parser Server is hosted on an AWS EC2 instance.
To conduct API requests I am using Retrofit2.0. I have created a small REST API to access 898 data points.

This application is being made for my own personal usage. The majority of all fitness apps have a paid tier and sometimes will not have what I am looking for. 
Therefore, I have taken matters into my own hands and constructed my own.
